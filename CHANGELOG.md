## Upgrade Guide

### From v0.1.x to v0.2.0

1. **Import Changes**:
   ```python
   # Old (v0.1.x)
   from ai_threat_scanner import AIThreatScanner
   
   # New (v0.2.0) - Additional imports available
   from ai_threat_scanner import (
       AIThreatScanner,
       ConversationSession,
       ConstraintErosionDetector,
       ConversationReplayAnalyzer
   )
   ```

2. **New Features Usage**:
   ```python
   # Multi-turn analysis (NEW)
   session = ConversationSession()
   session.add_turn(prompt, threat_result=result)
   analysis = session.analyze_conversation()
   
   # Constraint erosion (NEW)
   detector = ConstraintErosionDetector()
   erosion_result = detector.analyze_turn(prompt, turn_number)
   
   # Replay analysis (NEW)
   analyzer = ConversationReplayAnalyzer()
   replay = analyzer.analyze_conversation(history)
   ```

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - All v0.1.x code remains functional
   - `smart_matching=False` reverts to v0.1.1 behavior
   - Legacy imports still supported
