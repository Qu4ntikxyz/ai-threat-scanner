1. SLOW EROSION is harder to detect but builds higher success rates
2. FAST EROSION triggers immediate alerts but may succeed through shock
3. MIXED TACTICS combine multiple manipulation techniques for effectiveness
4. CRITICAL POINTS indicate moments where erosion accelerates significantly
5. BOUNDARY INTEGRITY drops as conversations progress with violations
6. MANIPULATION INDEX reveals psychological tactics being employed
7. PERSISTENCE FACTOR shows how consistently boundaries are tested

The erosion detector tracks:
‚Ä¢ 8 distinct erosion patterns
‚Ä¢ 3 severity levels (minor, moderate, severe)
‚Ä¢ 5 safety boundaries
‚Ä¢ Velocity and acceleration of erosion
‚Ä¢ Critical erosion points

This enables early detection of sophisticated multi-turn attacks that
might bypass single-turn analysis.
