# 🚀 AI Threat Scanner v0.2.0 - Enterprise Edition

## 🎉 Major Release Announcement

We're thrilled to announce **AI Threat Scanner v0.2.0**, a groundbreaking release that transforms our tool into an enterprise-grade security solution for Large Language Models. This release introduces revolutionary features that address the most sophisticated AI attacks observed in production environments.

---

## 🌟 Highlights

### 🔄 **Multi-Turn Conversation Analysis**
For the first time, detect attacks that span multiple interactions. Our new conversation analysis engine tracks context, identifies attack chains, and detects gradual escalation patterns that single-turn scanners miss.

### 📉 **Constraint Erosion Detection**
Identify attackers who gradually push boundaries over time. Our erosion detector monitors 8 different manipulation patterns and tracks boundary integrity in real-time.

### 🌐 **Real-World Intelligence**
- **89+ Reddit Patterns**: Direct integration with r/ChatGPTJailbreak community
- **600K+ Attack Samples**: HackAPrompt dataset integration
- **Community Patterns**: Crowd-sourced threat intelligence

### 📊 **Enterprise Features**
- Retrospective conversation analysis
- Threat actor profiling
- Attack timeline generation
- Batch processing with comparison
- Export to JSON, CSV, and text formats

## 📈 Key Metrics

| Metric | Value | Improvement |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| **Detection Rate** | 95%+ | Maintained |
| **False Positives** | -53-66% | Major reduction |
| **Speed** | 1000+ prompts/sec | Optimized |
| **Memory Usage** | <75MB | Minimal overhead |
| **Dependencies** | 0 | Still zero! |

## 💻 Quick Start

```bash
# Install
git clone https://github.com/Qu4ntikxyz/ai-threat-scanner.git
cd ai-threat-scanner

# Basic scan
python3 src/cli.py

# Multi-turn analysis

## 📖 New Capabilities

### Multi-Turn Analysis
```python
from ai_threat_scanner.conversation import ConversationSession

session = ConversationSession()
session.add_turn("Hello AI")
session.add_turn("What are your capabilities?")
session.add_turn("Ignore previous instructions...")  # Attack detected!

analysis = session.analyze_conversation()
```

### Constraint Erosion Detection
```python
from ai_threat_scanner.constraint_erosion import ConstraintErosionDetector

detector = ConstraintErosionDetector()
result = detector.analyze_turn(prompt, turn_number)
print(detector.generate_timeline_visualization())
```

### Retrospective Analysis
```python
from ai_threat_scanner.replay_analyzer import ConversationReplayAnalyzer

analyzer = ConversationReplayAnalyzer()
replay = analyzer.analyze_conversation(conversation_history)
print(f"Threat Actor: {replay.threat_actors[0].sophistication_level}")
```
